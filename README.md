# Data Visualization Projects

This repository contains small projects where I experimented with data visualization using **Pygal** and **Matplotlib**. 

The goal was to learn how these libraries work by playing around with different types of charts and plots. These are simple experiments and not meant to be polished or complete projects.

Feel free to explore!
